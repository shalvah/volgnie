<h2>Hi @<%= @locals[:user]["username"] %>, your Twitter purge is complete!</h2>

You triggered this purge at <%= @locals[:purge_trigger_time] %>, when you had
<b><%= @locals[:user]["followers_count"] %></b> followers. You asked us to
<i><%= Purge::Criteria::to_text(@locals[:level]) %></i>.

<br>
<br>

None of your followers matched that criteria, so no one was removed. You can try again with a more strict criteria.
