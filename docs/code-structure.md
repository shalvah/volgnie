# Code Structure

- `handler.rb`: the main Lambda functions
- `app/web.rb`: the Sinatra web app
- `rack_adapter.rb`, `config.ru`, `.serverless-rack`, `serverless_rack.rb`: files generated by serverless-rack so we can use Sinatra in a Lambda function
- `spec`: tests
- `sanities`: small scripts for directly testing a piece of functionality in production
- `views/`: HTML pages in the app (as [ERB templates](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.3.0/ERB.html))
- `app/`: main source code
  - `lib/`: tools for connecting to external services, dispatching events, and managing configuration
  - `purge/`: main purging logic

Note: a `.bundle/config` file is included, which sets gems to be installed into `vendor/`, so they can be packaged easily with the app.
